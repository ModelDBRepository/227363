This package contains the Genesis-code for the simulations in

Maex R, De Schutter E (1998)
Synchronization of Golgi and granule cell firing in a detailed 
network model of the cerebellar granule cell layer.
J. Neurophysiol. 80, 2521-2537.

For more info, please consult R. Maex at
reinoud.maex@uantwerpen.be.

Each subdirectory contains an executable Genesis script. 
The following model implementations are available.

Granule_cell : contains the scripts describing a single-compartmental
granule cell.  Allows for the computation of responses to current
injection and to synaptic stimulation, by running the executable TEST.g.

Golgi_cell : same as Granule_cell, but for a single-compartmental
Golgi cell.

Gran_layer_1D : describes a one-dimensional (parallel fiber axis)
segment of the cerebellar granular layer, containing mossy fibers,
granule and Golgi cells.  Mossy fibers are random spike generators.
Granule and Golgi cells are the single-compartmental neurons
implemented in the Granule_cell and Golgi_cell directories described
above. The densities of neurons and synapses, the synaptic
strengths/delays and their randomization intervals, and the patterns
of mossy fiber activity are variable parameters.


The code has been run on Sun Solaris, and Mac X Linux.
The channel tables are included. In case of incompatibility,
they can be recreated by uncommenting the TABSAVE comments in
Granule_cell/TEST.g and Golgi_cell/TEST.g.


16Mar2005 fixed bug in h channel (missing brackets around argument of exp}
(see Granule_cell/Gran_chan.g and Golgi_cell/Golg_chan.g)
